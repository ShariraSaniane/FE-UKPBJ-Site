<h2>Digital Solution for Job Data Management at UKPBJ âœ¨</h2>

In the UKPBJ work environment, managing and retrieving documents has been a significant challenge due to the lack of an online document storage system. Manual processes, which have been in place for a long time, not only consume a significant amount of time but also increase the risk of errors and data loss. To address these issues, the UKPBJ Site application was developed to improve efficiency and accuracy in job data management

The UKPBJ Site is an application designed to simplify the process of inputting data for each job by the Procurement Working Unit (UKPBJ). This application allows all documents to be stored online in a database, facilitating easy data search and management
